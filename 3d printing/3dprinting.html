 <center><h3> In this section an example of modelling for 3D printing is depicted. A cam gear mechanism is modelled using fusion 360, and<br>
printed using Ultimaker 5S 3d printing machine. </h3><br>
<h3> First we start by the modelling of the cam gear mechanism which is derived by human hand</h3> <br> 
<h3> The design consists of 5 parts which need to be modelled individually </h3> <br>

<h3> Cam Gear <br>
We start by sketching the profile of the cam gear using the ellipse tool, then sketching the material optimisation profiles. <br>

Then using the extrusion tool the final profile of the gear can take shape with a material thickness of 2 mm. <br>

<center><img src= "images\42.png" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>

Reciprocator Guide <br>
We start by sketching the profile of the reciprocator guide using the Rectangular tool, then sketching the spindle holder .<br>
<center><img src= "images\8.png" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>
Then using the extrusion tool the final profile of the guide  can take shape with a material thickness of 5 mm. <br>
<center><img src= "images\81.png" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>
notice that the spindle holder is supposed to allow the spindle to rotate freely so a tolerance of 1 mm is applied to the slot.<br>

Lever (Handle) <br>
We start by sketching the profile of the reciprocator guide using the rectangular and circle tools, then sketching the material optimisation profiles .<br>
<center><img src= "images\1.png" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>
Then Extruding the profiles using the extrusion tool with a material thickness of 3 mm <br>
<center><img src= "images\11.png" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>

Reciprocator <br>
Using the sketch tool we can derive the profile with the rectangular and circle tools, then sketching the material optimisation profiles. <br>
<center><img src= "images\3.png" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>
<center><img src= "images\2.png" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>

Extruding the profile with 3 mm thickness. <br>

Spindel <br>
By using the sketching tool we can create the profile of the spindle using the rectangular tool, then adding the material optimosation profile.<br>
<center><img src= "images\7.png" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>
<center><img src= "images\6.png" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>
The spindle is going to be having to deal with the load coming from human hand input, so adding a truss support profile is essential to avoid fracture.<br>
Using the extrude tool by a thickness of 2.9 mm, we can conclude the final profile of the spindle. <br>
<center><img src= "images\71.png" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>
notice that the spindle is supposed to be form fitted in the cam gear slot so the thickness of the spindle profile should be less than the cam slot.<br>

The final assembly should be having this profile. <br> 
<center><img src= "images\9.png" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>
<center><img src= "images\10.png" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>

The motion analysis of the mechanism should behave like follows. <br> </h3>

<h3> 3D printing <br>
In order to transform the fusion 360 files into readable additive manufacturing machines language we need to use a slicing program to transform<br>
the fusion 360 files into G-Code, which slices the solid models into multible slices in xyz coordinates<br>
we use the program Ultimaker Cura 4.8.0 for preparing the print. <br>
<center><img src= "images\curalogo.jpg" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>

After saving our individual parts as STL files we can import them into Ultimaker Cura 4.8.0 and place them correctly on the printing plate so that<br>
no overhang is allowed as the printing is done bottom up direction and the material need to be supported.<br>
<center><img src= "images\cura1.png" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>


By using these printing configurations we can prepare the parts for printing<br>
<center><img src= "images\cura2.png" width="600px" Height="400px"> <br></center>
<center><img src= "images\cura3.png" width="600px" Height="400px"> <br></center>
<center><img src= "images\cura4.png" width="600px" Height="400px"> <br></center>


Notice that for such a mechanical part a relatively high layer hight is recommended to optimise toughness and overcoming plastic elasticity.<br> 

After final checking for the printig specs we can press slice, the program starts to transform the solid parts into G-Code slices and opting out<br>
a time estimation of the print and a G-Code file. We save the file to our USB stick and the file is good to go to the Ultimaker S5.<br>
<center><img src= "images\curat.png" width="600px" Height="400px"> <br></center>


The ultimaker printing machine is qualified with a USB stick input slot which we can use it directly and choosing the file form the window and <br>
pressing Print.<br>

The final print will be looking like follows <br></h3>
<center><img src= "images\p2.jpg" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>
<center><img src= "images\p3.jpg" width="600px" Height="600px"> <br></center>

<h3>Conclusion <br></center>
- The print wasn't easily detachable from the printing plate because of not using a build plate adhesion.<br>
- The manual assymbly of the print didn't work as designed because of using a high layer hight (0.2mm) which ignored the (0.1) mm tolerances.<br>
- A redo of the fittings tolerances should be applied and optimised with the machine tolerance untill an effective assymbly is achived (Trial and Error) <br></h3>
