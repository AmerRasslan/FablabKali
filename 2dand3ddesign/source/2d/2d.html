<center><h3> The 2D modelling of the toothbrush reciprocal mechanism is done using the program LibreCAD as follows<h3> </center><br>
<h3> First the base is drafted to be shaped like a rectangular with holes for fixation <h3>

<h3> Then the reciprocal mechanism is based on a cam-gear and shaft, which can be modeled using the ellipse tool <h3> <br>

<h3> Then the reciprocal shaft which is holding the brush at its end can be modelled using lines and mirroring tools <h3> <br>

<h3>In order to hold the reciprocal shaft and the cam gear in constant contact, a spring loaded mechanism is added using basic circles and lines then the coping tool <h3><br>

<h3> The housing for the spring loaded mechanism is modelled using lines tool, then mirroring.<h3><br>
